### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a degree in physics.
I have worked with calculation engines for energy band structures of crystalline systems.
I had experience as an analyst in the seismological service.
I develop IoT projects using esp8266, arduinos and the implementation of my own circuits.

## About what's on my mind

 - The AI, neural networks and machine learning are a new branch of my interests.
 - Perform open source AI retrains for new applications.
 - Detector simulation using Geant4.
 - Automation of industrial processes.
