### Hi there 👋

I have a degree in physics.

I have worked with calculation engines for energy band structures of crystalline systems.

I had experience as an analyst in the seismological service.

I developed IoT projects using esp8266, arduinos and the implementation of my own circuits.

## About what's on my mind

 - The AI, neural networks and machine learning are a new branch of my interests.
 - Perform [open source AI](https://github.com/openai/) retrains for new applications.
 - Detector simulation using [Geant4](https://github.com/Geant4).
 - Automation of industrial processes.
